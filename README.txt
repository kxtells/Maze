Welcome to MAZE
-------------------------------
This repo contains the source code of the game MAZE!.

This game basically appears after creating a DFS algorithm for random mazes.
It seemed fun to draw the mazes on screen just to check the results more easily,
after that just added some stuff to make a game

Basic Idea:
----------
- Multiple levels (random mazes)
- You are a square that moves automatically at constant speed,you only control the direction
- There are 5 checkpoints in each level that the player has to touch
- Once the checkpoints are completed the player can reach the end
- Repeat until infinity
